Scripts for packaging TextAdept.
Build packages, by copying compiled binaries to standard destination directories.
Follow the directions for your OS below, which will create packages to overwrite
these same files in those same directories.

MICROSOFT WINDOWS
Requires InnoSetup from http://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php

Open textadept.iss, and check that directories have not changed.
Edit the version number, and compile.

MAC OS X
Requires EPM from http://epmhome.org/

Edit version number at top of build-mac.sh
Running this shell script creates textadept.list
Running `sudo epm -f pkg textadept` creates a subdirectory with a name like
"macosx" with your new package.

LINUX-LIKE SYSTEMS
Requires EPM from http://epmhome.org/

Edit version number at top of build-linux.sh
Check the bottom of the shell script, to ensure that textadept.desktop and
ta_48x48.png exist, and that the directories are correct.

Running this shell script creates textadept.list
Running `sudo epm textadept` creates a subdirectory with a name like "linux"
with your new package. You may need some command-line flags, such as
 -a amd64	for 64bit Architecture
 -f deb		for ubuntu File package
